    "description":"\"Written by Abu 'l-Qasim Hasan Ferdowsi, the Shahnameh, otherwise known as the “Book of Kings” is considered the longest poem written by a single person. It is folklore composed of history, literature, mythology, and propaganda woven with Persian culture. Within the Shahnameh one will find 990 chapters spread between 62 stories composed of 60,000 rhyming couplets. The revival of the Persian language and Iranian culture are said to have been dependent on the Shahnameh. It has permeated Iranian society and as such, it has greatly influenced those who hold so tightly onto the ancient legacy of Iran....\""},

    "description":"\"What is interesting about the men in this corner is that logically, they should look bigger given that they are closer to the viewer, the appear smaller than Ibrahim Sultan who should appear further away. This could be indicative of Ibrahim Sultan’s importance, emphasizing him as the most powerful of the men depicted in the photo. The men are also wearing muted colours in contrast to Ibrahim Sultan who is donning bright blue, red and gold. The drab clothing that the men in the bottom right corner are wearing make them fade into the background which causes them to look unimportant or secondary ;\""},
