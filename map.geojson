    "description":"\"A popular cartographic form used to depict U.S. and Canadian cities and towns during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was the panoramic map. Known also as bird's-eye views, perspective maps, panoramas, and aero views, panoramic maps are nonphotographic representations of cities, portrayed as if viewed from above at an oblique angle. Although not generally drawn to scale, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features in perspective.\" (Hebert & Dempsey)"},

    "description":"\"Written by Abu 'l-Qasim Hasan Ferdowsi, the Shahnameh, otherwise known as the “Book of Kings” is considered the longest poem written by a single person. It is folklore composed of history, literature, mythology, and propaganda woven with Persian culture. Within the Shahnameh one will find 990 chapters spread between 62 stories composed of 60,000 rhyming couplets. The revival of the Persian language and Iranian culture are said to have been dependent on the Shahnameh. It has permeated Iranian society and as such, it has greatly influenced those who hold so tightly onto the ancient legacy of Iran....\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},

In view of the magnitude of the work, the originality of the idea, and the difficulties encountered in carrying it out, it is hoped that if any mistakes or errors have crept into the plates or pages, they will be looked upon with a lenient eye by an indulgent public.\" (Dry & Compton)"},
